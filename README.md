## 💡 How It Works

### 1. **Skill Extraction**
The app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and categorize skills from your input:
- Technical skills (programming languages, frameworks, tools)
- Domain skills (industry-specific knowledge)
- Soft skills (communication, leadership, problem-solving)

### 2. **Career Mapping**
Based on your current role and skills, the system:
- Calculates transition feasibility scores
- Identifies transferable skills
- Maps optimal career paths
- Estimates transition duration

### 3. **Readiness Assessment**
Comprehensive scoring based on:
- Current skills match (35%)
- Transferable skills (25%)
- Learning curve (20%)
- Market demand (20%)

### 4. **Learning Path Generation**
Personalized recommendations including:
- Priority skills to develop
- Curated course suggestions
- Project ideas
- Certification paths

## 🛠️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Industry definitions and skills
- Scoring weights
- UI colors and themes
- Learning platform URLs

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Industry Skills**: Curated from O*NET, LinkedIn, and industry reports
- **Course Catalog**: Aggregated from Coursera, Udemy, edX, and other platforms
- **Market Data**: Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics and industry trends

## 🔧 Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Formatting
```bash
black .
flake8 .
```
